# 1Ô∏è‚É£üêùüèéÔ∏è The One Billion Row Challenge

The One Billion Row Challenge (1BRC) is a fun exploration of how far modern Java can be pushed for aggregating one billion rows from a text file.
Grab all your (virtual) threads, reach out to SIMD, optimize your GC, or pull any other trick, and create the fastest implementation for solving this task!

The text file contains temperature values for a range of weather stations.
Each row is one measurement in the format `<string: station name>;<double: measurement>`, with the measurement value having exactly one fractional digit.
The following shows ten rows as an example:

```
Hamburg;12.0
Bulawayo;8.9
Palembang;38.8
St. John's;15.2
Cracow;12.6
Bridgetown;26.9
Istanbul;6.2
Roseau;34.4
Conakry;31.2
Istanbul;23.0
```

The task is to write a Java program which reads the file, calculates the min, mean, and max temperature value per weather station, and emits the results on stdout like this
(i.e. sorted alphabetically by station name, and the result values per station in the format `<min>/<mean>/<max>`, rounded to one fractional digit):

```
{Abha=-23.0/18.0/59.2, Abidjan=-16.2/26.0/67.3, Ab√©ch√©=-10.0/29.4/69.0, Accra=-10.1/26.4/66.4, Addis Ababa=-23.7/16.0/67.0, Adelaide=-27.8/17.3/58.5, ...}
```

Submit your implementation by Jan 31 2024 and become part of the leaderboard!

1. Build the project using Apache Maven:

    ```
    ./mvnw clean verify
    ```

2. Create the measurements file with 1B rows (just once):

    ```
    ./create_measurements.sh 1000000000
    ```

    This will take a few minutes.
    **Attention:** the generated file has a size of approx. **12 GB**, so make sure to have enough diskspace.

    If you're running the challenge with a non-Java language, there's a non-authoritative Python script to generate the measurements file at `src/main/python/create_measurements.py`. The authoritative method for generating the measurements is the Java program `dev.morling.onebrc.CreateMeasurements`.

3. Calculate the average measurement values:

    ```
    ./calculate_average_baseline.sh
    ```

    The provided naive example implementation uses the Java streams API for processing the file and completes the task in ~2 min on environment used for [result evaluation](#evaluating-results).
    It serves as the base line for comparing your own implementation.

4. Optimize the heck out of it:

    Adjust the `CalculateAverage` program to speed it up, in any way you see fit (just sticking to a few rules described below).
    Options include parallelizing the computation, using the (incubating) Vector API, memory-mapping different sections of the file concurrently, using AppCDS, GraalVM, CRaC, etc. for speeding up the application start-up, choosing and tuning the garbage collector, and much more.
